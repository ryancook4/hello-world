This repository is for Question 3 on Homework 1 of my Unstructured Data Analytics course


This README message is also an opportunity for me to tell you why the Cleveland Browns will make the playoffs for the first time since 2002.  It all starts with the Cleveland run game, which is currently being handled by a strong committee led by Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt, and Coach Kevin Stefanski has demonstrated that he will lean on the Browns revamped offensive line and his backs' ability to gain yards after contact.  This is Baker Mayfield's first year with a competent head coach, and we have already seen how Stefanski plans to get Baker out of the pocket on Play Action rollouts to give him higher percentage throws to his outside weapons.  The offense is clicking enough to average over 30 points per game, but the defense still has room for improvement... perhaps I will include a short analysis of the defense in my next commit.
